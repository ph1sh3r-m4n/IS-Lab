# HealthCare Inc., a leading healthcare provider, has implemented a secure patient data
# management system using the Rabin cryptosystem. The system allows authorized
# healthcare professionals to securely access and manage patient records across multiple
# hospitals and clinics within the organization. Implement a Python-based centralized key
# management service that can:
# • Key Generation: Generate public and private key pairs for each hospital and clinic
# using the Rabin cryptosystem. The key size should be configurable (e.g., 1024 bits).
# • Key Distribution: Provide a secure API for hospitals and clinics to request and receive
# their public and private key pairs.
# • Key Revocation: Implement a process to revoke and update the keys of a hospital or
# clinic when necessary (e.g., when a facility is closed or compromised).
# • Key Renewal: Automatically renew the keys of all hospitals and clinics at regular
# intervals (e.g., every 12 months) to maintain the security of the patient data management
# system.
# • Secure Storage: Securely store the private keys of all hospitals and clinics, ensuring
# that they are not accessible to unauthorized parties.
# • Auditing and Logging: Maintain detailed logs of all key management operations, such
# as key generation, distribution, revocation, and renewal, to enable auditing and
# compliance reporting.
# • Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that the key management service and its operations are
# compliant with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA).
# • Perform a trade-off analysis to compare the workings of Rabin and RSA
