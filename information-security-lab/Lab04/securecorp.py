# SecureCorp is a large enterprise with multiple subsidiaries and business units located
# across different geographical regions. As part of their digital transformation initiative,
# the IT team at SecureCorp has been tasked with building a secure and scalable
# communication system to enable seamless collaboration and information sharing
# between their various subsystems.
# The enterprise system consists of the following key subsystems:
# 1. Finance System (System A): Responsible for all financial record-keeping, accounting,
# and reporting.
# 2. HR System (System B): Manages employee data, payroll, and personnel related
# processes.
# 3. Supply Chain Management (System C): Coordinates the flow of goods, services, and
# information across the organization's supply chain
# These subsystems need to communicate securely and exchange critical documents, such
# financial reports, employee contracts, and procurement orders, to ensure the enterprise's
# overall efficiency.
# The IT team at SecureCorp has identified the following requirements for the secure
# communication and document signing solution:
# 1. Secure Communication: The subsystems must be able to establish secure
# communication channels using a combination of RSA encryption and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
