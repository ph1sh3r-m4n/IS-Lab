## [Sqlninja](https://sqlninja.sourceforge.net/)

Sqlninja's main goal is to get interactive OS-level access on the remote DB server and to use it as a foothold in the target network. As an experimental feature, it can also extract data from the database. In a nutshell, here's what it does:

-   Fingerprint of the remote SQL Server (version, user performing the queries, user privileges, xp_cmdshell availability, DB Server authentication mode)
-   Bruteforce of the 'sa' password (SQL Server 2000 only)
-   Privilege escalation to 'sa' (SQL Server 2000 only)
-   Creation of a custom xp_cmdshell if the original one has been disabled
-   Upload of executables
-   Reverse scan in order to look for a port that can be used for a reverse shell
-   Direct and reverse shell, both TCP and UDP
-   DNS tunneled pseudoshell, when no ports are available for a bindshell
-   ICMP tunneled shell, if the target DBMS can communicate via ICMP Echo with the attacking machine
-   Metasploit wrapping, when you want to use Meterpreter or even want to get GUI access on the remote DB server
-   OS privilege escalation on the remote DB server using token kidnapping or through CVE-2010-0232
-   Extraction of data from the remote DB, using WAITFOR-based inference or DNS-based tunnels
-   All of the above can be done with obfuscated SQL code, in order to confuse IDS/IPS systems

## [Microsoft Threat Model]()

hreat modeling is a core element of the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). It’s an engineering technique you can use to help you identify threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures that could affect your application. You can use threat modeling to shape your application's design, meet your company's security objectives, and reduce risk.

![threat_modeling](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/response:VP1-539x349)

There are five major threat modeling steps:

-   Defining security requirements.  
-   Creating an application diagram.  
-   Identifying threats.  
-   Mitigating threats.  
-   Validating that threats have been mitigated.

Threat modeling should be part of your routine development lifecycle, enabling you to progressively refine your threat model and further reduce risk.

The Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool makes threat modeling easier for all developers through a standard notation for visualizing system components, data flows, and security boundaries. It also helps threat modelers identify classes of threats they should consider based on the structure of their software design. We designed the tool with non-security experts in mind, making threat modeling easier for all developers by providing clear guidance on creating and analyzing threat models.

he Threat Modeling Tool enables any developer or software architect to:

-   Communicate about the security design of their systems.  
-   Analyze those designs for potential security issues using a proven methodology. 
-   Suggest and manage mitigations for security issues.
